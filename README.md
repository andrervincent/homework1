This is the repository for the first homework assignment for Structure of Programming Languages. This assignment requires that:
1. A function that returns a reversed version of a list
2. A function that returns the sum of all numbers(presumably integers) in a list, without nested lists.
3. A function that returns the sum of all numbers(presumably integers) in a list, WITH nested lists' values included.
4. A function that returns the smallest number of list1 that is larger than the smallest number of list2

This assignment will be done in scheme, a functional programming language.
